# Archive Note: A better python wrapper for uptime kuma has been developed here: https://github.com/jayakornk/pyuptimekuma

# Uptime Kuma HACS integration

This integration is temporary and is expected to soon be merged into HomeAssistant Core, but until then it will be available via HACS.

## Usage

Install using HACS and setup like any other integration via the UI. Enter the uptime kuma instane url and credentials.

The URL needs to be the full url with HTTP://HOST:PORT or HTTPS://HOST
